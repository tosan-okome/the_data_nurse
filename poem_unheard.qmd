Can walls talk?

Perhaps.

We don't hear them

Because we are not paying attention.

Another shadow in our periphery

To be dismissed,

To be ignored.

Perhaps,

With a copious amount of words,

And a resounding drum for them to sound on,

The walls could finally be noticed.

But if such false boisterousness

Is what it takes,

I would rather remain unheard

Just like the walls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can trees smile? 

Perhaps.

We never see them do.

Maybe they have no reason to.

No one compliments them,

Gives them a hug.

Perhaps,

If they try really hard,

They could soften the hard lines 

Carved into their barks

And re-shapen them 

Forcefully

To an up-turned rainbow.

But If it has to be forced,

I would rather hide my smile 

Just like the trees. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can fishes cry? 

Perhaps. 

We never notice 

Because they drown in their tears daily.

Perhaps, 

If they held their breaths, 

Risk bringing their heads

Out of the tears

They breathe in to survive,

Someone will look long enough

To notice,

But not long enough

For their lungs to give out.

But if I have to hold my breath,

Take a risk

Waiting for my tears to be seen,

I would rather hide my tears

Just like the fishes.
